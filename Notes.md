# Jupyter Notebook Notes

## Python

As it stands, the students would need to implement their code in actual python. But I could implement a simplistic code parser in python. I could then read the string containing the code that they wrote, parse that, and then execute the parsed code.

## Sage

A second option would be to use a sage kernel, and have them continue to use sage. All of the interactivity should still work as intended.
