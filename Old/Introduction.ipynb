    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose and high-level programming language. It is very easy to learn, and easy to read. Python has many tools that have been made for it that allow for more advanced usage without much difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines and Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not use the braces that other languages use to indicate blocks of code, instead the indentation of the code plays the role of this. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if True:\n",
    "    print(\"True\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"False\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python accepts single (``'``), double (``\"``) and triple(``\"\"\"``) to denote strings. Triple quotes denote multi-line strings. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "word = 'word'\n",
    "sentence = \"This is a sentence.\"\n",
    "paragraph = \"\"\"This is a paragraph. It is\n",
    "made up of multiple lines and sentences.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are parts of the code that will not be executed. In python comments are denoted by a hash sign (``#``) any code that comes after a hash sign will be ignored.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\") # This is a second comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "User input can be requested through the use of the ``input`` function. This function returns the string of whatever the user typed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "food = input(\"What is your favorite food? \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement groups is anything that would be followed by a block of code. For example functions, classes, if statements, etc. Each of these expressions begins with the expression then on the same line it is followed by a colon (``:``). All the indented lines after a colon will be part of that code block. Note that after a colon, there must be some indented code, if you want to do noting, use the ``pass`` identifier. This tells python to do nothing for that code block.\n",
