Where ``START`` is the starting index of the slice, ``END`` is the ending index of the slice, and ``STEP`` is the step size of the slice. The step provides a way to skip characters, if one used step size of ``2`` then it would skip every other character. If any part is left blank then it is presumed, ``START`` will default to ``0``, ``END`` will default to ``len(LIST)``, and ``STEP`` will default to ``1``. Note that negative values can also be used.
